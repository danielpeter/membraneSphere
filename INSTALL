Installation from sources
=========================

cd into the subfolder ./propagation

run ./make or specify the desired executable 

./make propagation

./make adjointMethod

./make timelag

./make heterogeneousPhaseshift

which will produce the executables. 



The codes are written in Fortran90 and require MPI libraries.
Use the appropriate compiler flags in the Makefile by setting 
F90, FFLAGS, LDFLAGS.

In the file include/commonModules.f90, you can choose the working precision
for the executables (use default single, it'll do it).
