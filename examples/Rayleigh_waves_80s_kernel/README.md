# adjoint kernel - Rayleigh waves at 80 s

This example simulates Rayleigh waves at 80 s period and computes a cross-correlation traveltime sensitivity kernel
by the adjoint method.

The kernel is for a single source-receiver pair, using a heterogeneous phase-velocity map as background.
The simulation input parameters are in file `Parameter_Input`, the kernel computation is done by the executable `bin/adjointMethod`.

To run this example, type:
```
$ ./run_this_example.sh
```
